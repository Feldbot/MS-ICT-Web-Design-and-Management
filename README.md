# Web Design and Management Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4505 - Web Design and Management](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4505) is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). This course explores best-practices in information architecture and user-centered design techniques to plan, build, and manage websites.

## Project Information
A course requirement was to build or redesign a website for a real-world client. I worked with professional painter Paul Grass to redesign his WordPress website. A primary focus of the project was to capture the business requirements for the redesign, which can be seen below in the site specification document (SSD). The SSD was the result of an ongoing collaborative effort between the developer and client, and served to keep the project scope on track. The SSD also served as a useful road map to rebuild the site. The client was extremely happy with the redesign efforts and saw an increase in traffic and buisiness after the launch.
